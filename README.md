# About_William_Leverette
A short Description of myself. May contain some examples of coding I have done.

Hello, and thank you for taking the time to learn a little about myself. My name is William Leverette, and I am a recent graduate from the University of Missouri-Kansas City. I studied Electrical and Computer Engineering as well as physics for my Undergraduate degrees. This repository and the others connected to myself are a reflection of the work I have done the last few years, and several projects I am currently working on for my own interest.

 Currently I am seeking a position as programmer/Embedded systems engineer. I am actively interested in any position that requires reading sensors and making decisions based on those readings. I am also open to discussing similar positions within this field.
